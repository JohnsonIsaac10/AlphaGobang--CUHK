# AlphaGobang--CUHK
This is the second part of the term project finished in Term 2 in CUHK. <br>
Based on AlphaZero, the famous algorithm that has achieved superior performance in the game of Go, we attempted to implement an algorithm to play the game of Gobang on an 8Ã—8-sized board, which is called Alpha Gobang. <br>
The algorithm is implemented based on Pytorch. <br>
The term report and the the slides of English presentation are presented here. <br>
